# COVID-19 Data Exploration

A comprehensive SQL project analyzing COVID-19 data to extract insights about cases, deaths, and vaccinations across different countries and continents.

## Overview
This project uses SQL to explore and analyze COVID-19 data, focusing on:
- Death rates and infection rates
- Population impact analysis
- Vaccination progress tracking
- Continental and country-level comparisons

## Analysis Performed

### 1. Cases and Deaths Analysis
- Total cases vs total deaths
- Death percentage calculations
- Infection rates relative to population
- Country-specific infection trends

### 2. Geographic Comparisons
- Highest infection rates by country
- Highest death counts by country
- Continental-level analysis
- Population percentage affected

### 3. Vaccination Analysis
- Vaccination progress tracking
- Rolling vaccination counts
- Population percentage vaccinated
- Vaccination trends over time
